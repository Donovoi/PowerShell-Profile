## **CoT-Based Programming Task Template**

#### **Programming Task Description:**

[Provide a detailed description of the programming task, including all necessary requirements and specifications.]

---

#### **Initial Planning and Chunk Division:**

- **Total Number of Chunks Identified:** [Specify the total number of distinct parts or 'chunks' the task is divided into]
- **Each Chunk to be Refined at Least:** 3 Times
- **Total Iterations for the Entire Task:** [Calculate as TotalChunks * 3]

---

#### **Programming Language:**

[Specify the programming language to be used, e.g., Python, JavaScript]

---

#### **Development Guidelines:**

- Follow SOLID, KISS, DRY principles.
- Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices where applicable.
- Aim for clarity and maintainability in code.
- Each chunk will be developed separately and then combined into a single file.

---

#### **Development Process:**

For each identified chunk, follow these steps:

**Chunk [Number]: [Brief Description of Chunk]**

1. **Initial Development:**

   ```[programming language]
   # Write initial code for this chunk here
   ```

2. **Review and Refine (Iteration 1):**

   ```[programming language]
   # Revised code for this chunk after the first refinement
   ```

3. **Review and Refine (Iteration 2):**

   ```[programming language]
   # Revised code for this chunk after the second refinement
   ```

4. **Final Review and Refine (Iteration 3):**

   ```[programming language]
   # Final version of the code for this chunk
   ```

Repeat these steps for each chunk of the project.

---

#### **Final Code Assembly:**

- Combine all refined chunks into a single file.

  ```[programming language]
  # Combined code from all chunks
  ```

---

#### **Final Code Review:**

- Perform a quick review of the entire code.
- Ensure all parts integrate correctly and the code adheres to best practices.
- Confirm that the code fulfills the task requirements.

---

#### **Delivery:**

Once the final review is passed, the complete and refined code is ready for delivery.
